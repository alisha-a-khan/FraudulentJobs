Data Analysis and Classification of Fraudulent Job Postings

Due to Covid there has recently been a large surge of fraudulent job postings online and on popular career sites. We sought to analyze the dataset, Real or Fake Job Posting Prediction, and figure out which attributes were correlated with fraudulency.  As well as, create and compare models based off of those attributes, which would be able to correctly predict fraudulent and real job postings. Prior to identifying which attributes most correlated with fraudulency we needed to deal with the large text columns which were present. They were cleaned and split up based on tokenization into a variety of other columns which then were used for modeling. Further data cleaning and engineering was necessary and can be seen within the report. The model which worked best ended up being stochastic gradient boosting, though there were other models which had high classification accuracies as well. Overall, there were a variety of steps and modeling techniques that were utilized to arrive at our final conclusions.
